## Innovation ID
IR2026-1011607

## Project Domain
Cyber Security (ICT)

## Team Members
- Janarthanan (M.Sc Information Security & Digital Forensics)
- Joel Jose Jaji (M.Sc Information Security & Digital Forensics)

## Project Description
This project analyzes encryption and decryption time of AES and RSA algorithms using Python. 
Performance is tested across multiple file sizes and results are stored in SQLite database.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Cryptography Library
- PyCryptodome
- SQLite

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   pip install cryptography pycryptodome

2. Run:
   python main.py

## Output
- Encryption & Decryption time comparison
- Database file: encryption_results.db
